Multicovariate Linear Regression Using R

The data is about graduate admission prediction for a US Institution depending upon SOP, LOR, CGPA, GRE score, TOEFL score, and Research publications. 
The response variable is "Chance_of_admit". I have tried to build the best model to predict chance_of_admit using Multicovraite Linear Regression.
